Nanmaran Anbupalam, 28, Sydney

Moved to Sydney in 2016 from Chennai, India to study Bsc. Exercise and Sports Science. Worked as Head Trainer and Manager across various F45 studios from 2018-2021. 

The instability in the fitness industry caused by COVID moved compelled me to consider a change in my chosen career path. 

Currently, working on sharpening my skills in programming and data wrangling to build a career as a Data Analyst / Data Scientist. I hope to use my Mathematical and analytical knowledge gained through my education and combine it with my marketing, sales and interpersonal skills accrued via employment.
